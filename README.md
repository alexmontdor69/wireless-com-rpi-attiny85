# Wireless Communication between a Raspberry Pi Zero W and attiny85
## Project description
Test the serial communication between a Raspberry Pi Zero W and attiny85. The project will use a wireless device (GT38)

## Configuration
Each Devices need to be setup
### Raspberry PI Zero W
Set GPIO to 1 (ref : )
Use the Serial module (physical pin 8 (TX) and 10 (RX) on the GPIO) and power the serial device communicator at 3.3V (apparently this is the optimal voltage)

### Attiny 85
Flash with a 1Mhz internal clock
Physical Transmission Pins : 2(TX) and 3(RX)

### GT38
Serial communication would be:

Baud
